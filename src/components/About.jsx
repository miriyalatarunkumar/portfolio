          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            As a CS undergrad, I intend to push my limits and make use of my
            abilities to the fullest to help achieve my short and long term
            goals. I believe in widening onesâ€™ skill tree, thus I am excited to
            keep learning about new technologies.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            So far in my journey, I have delved into a lot of key areas of CS
            whilst learning a lot of things along the way. I specialize in
            building full-stack web applications. Though I am most proficient in
            building web applications using MERN stack, I am a quick learner and
            can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great
            developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best
            tool for the job.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I strongly believe that good communication and leadership lead to
            great results and I have been fortunate to have successfully led
            teams in curriculum projects and other non-technical events. I
            consider myself creative and hardworking, as my stats show. If you
            liked my profile so far, drop me a message and we'll discuss how I
            can be useful to your project.
